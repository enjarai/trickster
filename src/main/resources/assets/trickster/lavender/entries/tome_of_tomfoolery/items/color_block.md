Fashioned of clay and held together by a simple glass frame,
this blob of gray mass seems rather unremarkable. 
However, with a sprinkling of spell ink mixed into the clay, it becomes an excellent conductor for mana.

;;;;;

Given the right instructions using the [Ploy of Pigmentation](^trickster:ploys/block#17),
mana can be used to rearrange the internal structure of this vessel,
changing the color it reflects back into the world.


It should be noted that, miraculously, this process is completely lossless.

Infused Ceramic can be created in a crafting table.
