*"I kept a bullet in the chamber for a rainy day."*


*"But what's the point in planning for it anyway?"*


*"I've got too many colors for a shade of gray."*


*"And I can make it autumn every single day."*

These tricks give access to color information.
Color fragments can represent any color along with translucency. 


They are {#aa4444}Addable{}, {#aa4444}Multiplicable{}, {#aa4444}Roundable{}, and {#aa4444}Averageable{}, but not {#aa4444}Subtractable{} or {#aa4444}Divisible{}

;;;;;

Addition mixes colors through an operation known as "screen."


Multiplication simply mixes multiplicatively.


Averaging mixes colors as one would with leather equipment.


Flooring and ceiling a color coerces it to the nearest result of Pigment and Vibrant Ingress, respectively. Rounding coerces to the nearest of either.

Given a dye item type, returns the color that the dye applies to leather armor.


Given glass, returns a fully transparent color.


Given a vector, gets the color that has been imbued into the block at that position.

Functions identically, except for the case of dye item types. 
The colors produced are much more intense, similar to the result of mixing glow ink with the dye.
