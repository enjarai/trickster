<|revision@trickster:templates|revision-id=trickster:add_subcircle|>

Can be used to add a new subcircle to any circle. 

;;;;;

![](trickster:textures/gui/img/extension_revision.png,fit)

When Extensive Revision is drawn in the blue circle, the green circle will be created.

;;;;;

<|revision@trickster:templates|revision-id=trickster:add_inner_circle|>

Adds a new inner circle to an existing circle.
Inner circles act like glyphs, and can be activated as such.
See [Spell Deviations](^trickster:tricks/functions).

;;;;;

![](trickster:textures/gui/img/inner_revision.png,fit)

When Inner Revision is drawn in the outer blue circle, the green circle will be created.

;;;;;

An inner circle acts like a glyph, 
either returning its value, or being executed with arguments.


When no subcircles are connected to it, 
the circle containing the inner circle will return the inner circle as a spell fragment.
This can be used for meta-programming, recursion, and permanent storage of dynamic spells, among other things.

;;;;;

When the circle *does* have connected subcircles, 
it executes the inner circle directly as if it was called by a [Grand Deviation](^trickster:tricks/functions#4),
using the results from the subcircles connected to the outer circle as parameters.


This can be very useful when needing to use one value in multiple places, 
as inner circles and spell fragments are the only way to move fragments back to the leaves of a tree.

;;;;;

<|revision@trickster:templates|revision-id=trickster:to_subcircle|>

Replaces the circle it is drawn in with a new circle, with the old circle as a subcircle.
