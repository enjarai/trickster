# The Trickster License

Hai! Hello! It seems you've found the license file for Trickster.
I'm Evelyn, known on the internet as enjarai.
Me and my best friend Aurora (known as aurakle) have designed and built this project together, and we are very proud of it.

Trickster is a project that is dear to both of our hearts.
As such, we want to create some more nuance than what most "standard" software licenses would allow for,
and create our own "crayon" license.

This document expresses our honest wishes for this project and how it is to be used in plain English, 
no lawyerspeak or anything of the sort.
We are aware that this license may not hold up in a court of law,
though we strongly doubt things will ever come to anything of the sort. 
If it does, we reserve all rights to this software.
Having said that, we'd ask anyone that *isn't* a lawyer 
(especially mod publishing platforms like Modrinth and CurseForge)
to respect the terms as we outline them in this document when using Trickster.

## For users and modpack authors

It does not apply to the source code or assets themselves.
